# Dojo Arena

The purpose of this assignment was to create a opening sequence of a Street Fighter -like game.
When the document loads, the game window with a Select Arena module with 6 different background options will pop up. When the user hovers over each button, a correct image of the arena will be displayed onto the game window. When the user selects an Arena, the selected background will be fixed, and a new module will appear that allows the user(s) to select their player characters.
